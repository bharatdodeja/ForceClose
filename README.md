# ForceClose

All Android developers must have faced force close issue while developing an application.
Here is a method to catch that error and treat it elegantly.

This will create an error page kind of mechanism in your Android application. So whenever your application is crashed user will not be able to see that irritating popup dialog. Instead of that app will display a predefined view to the user.

To make such kind of mechanism we need to create one error handler and an Activity class which will gain the view whenever the app gets forced closed.
